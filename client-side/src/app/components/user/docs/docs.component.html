  <h2>Why use Docker?</h2>

  <p>
    Containerization is a highly efficient approach for packaging and deploying software applications within a lightweight, portable, and self-contained environment known as a container. These containers operate as isolated entities, distinct from the host system and other containers on the same host, ensuring the seamless and dependable execution of applications across diverse environments.
